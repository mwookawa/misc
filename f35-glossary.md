1. Blocks -- Software Module with name [1-9][a-zA-Z] such that all blocks running concurrently on the same vehicle have disjoint functionality. Blocks for F35 are written primarily in C++.
2. Platform TR1 -- Initial hardware platform for avionics software block 2A-B. 2A was intended to be training-only, while 2B was intended to be initial (possibly targeting TR2, but unsure) hardware-ready version with enough functionality for basic flight
2. Block 2A -- Simulator avionics software for pilot training prior to airframes existing
3. Block 2B -- First version avionics software. Targeted 20hrs of flight time per boot. Achieved 0hrs (maybe a few test take-off and lands)
4. Platform TR2 -- Platform (possibly ca. 2012-2015?) that followed Platform TR1, which was deemed insufficient due to performance.
5. Platform TR3 -- "Open Architecture" hardware platform intended to follow Platform TR2. Intended for Block 3F?
6. Block 3i -- When decision was made to instantiate TR2 as first "mission ready" hardware platform, Block 2B was revised into Block 3i, the avionics platform for Platform TR2. It appears that this was the first attempted deployment block, and was famous for initially a. failing to take off. b. crashing hard (down to an bare-metal-HLT-and-reboot via battery-cycling) every 4 hours of actual in-air flight time). c. catching fire in england (tyrol? gaerol? look again for this).
6. Block 3i.R30-ish -- revised 3i that achieved "15hrs flight time between reboots on average". look for more references on this. Unclear, but I believe 3i's instability was blamed on heisenbugs due to concurrency and that follow-ons were claimed to be fully sequential (this may have been CYA explanation).
7. Block 3F -- I don't think this actually exists as a piece of runnable software yet, but I think once 3i is signed off on as the initial deployment software (ie, certified as ready to fly by the air force), 3F will be the only active block in development for avionics. It seems clear that 3F is targeted and will only run on Platform TR3.
